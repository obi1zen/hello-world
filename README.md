In ancient Japan, a warrior stood tall,
With courage and honor, he answered the call,
To serve his lord with loyalty and grace,
A samurai warrior, a noble face.

His sword gleamed bright in the morning sun,
A symbol of power, a battle won,
His armor strong, his spirit pure,
He fought for justice, of that you can be sure.

Through fields of battle, he bravely rode,
His skill with the blade, renowned and showed,
Defeating enemies, protecting the weak,
A samurai warrior, humble and meek.

But it wasn't all glory, for the samurai knew,
The path of the warrior was tough and true,
He trained day and night, honing his skill,
With discipline and focus, his destiny to fulfill.

His code was strict, his honor untamed,
To die in battle, his ultimate claim,
But he valued peace, above all else,
A warrior's heart, devoid of self.

Respected by all, feared by some,
The samurai warrior, a kingdom's chum,
His legacy lives on, in tales of old,
A warrior's story, forever told.

So let us remember, the samurai's creed,
Courage and honor, in our time of need,
For in our hearts, their spirit lives,
A samurai warrior, always gives.
